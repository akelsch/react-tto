This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It is an interactive tic-tac-toe game which you can find on the official [React tutorial page](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html).

I will add the following features which are called "ideas for improvements" in the tutorials wrap up section:

1. Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
2. Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
